# Welcome to Sharkdle! ðŸ¦ˆ

## How To Play:

You have 12 guesses to guess the correct shark. Start by guessing a shark!

### Examples:

The family, order and genus are grey, that means they are wrong. 
The YOD (year of discovery) is yellow, that means the target sharks YOD is a later date

The family and order are green, they are correct but the genus is wrong!

The sharks name is red, so it has to be a different shark with the same properties
